# Hexagonal Whishlist

An accompanying repository to [this]() blog post.

## Disclaimer

This is of course an extremely oversimplified example created for educational purposes, but still a valid one
since adding any number of ports, adapters or use cases will follow basically the same pattern.
Restructuring / refactoring the project in any way will not affect the responsibilities of it's components etc...

The bottom line is that you `need too know your hexagon` and everything else will come.
